Transistor story from Larry my 80 year old neighbor

Simon Winchester the author of the Perfectionists Looks At History Of Precision Engineering
https://www.npr.org/2018/05/07/608590826/in-the-perfectionists-simon-winchester-looks-at-history-of-precision-engineering

A transistor when it was invented in 1947 was about as big as your hand.

There are more transistors in the world today than there are leaves on all the trees in all the world.

A modern transistor is much smaller than the wavelength of light, which means you can't possibly even see it.

::: notes
- my laptop has a quad core i7 with over 2.1 billion transistors
- A12 Bionic, for the iPhone XS, XS Max and XR. The 7nm chip has 6.9 billion transistors.
- A12X Bionic, for the iPad Pro 10 billion transistors. 7nm
- A14 Bionic 11.8 Billion 5nm
- M1 16 Billion

This goes even higher for GPUs like the Nvidia 30 series at 28 Billion

## Thinking back...

## What was your first computer?

## 1983 TI-99/4A

## Then, modded 8088
- 8088 had 29,000 transistors
- Family Computer
- NEC V20 upgrade to 10Mhz (up from 4.77Mhz)
- 63,000 transistors baby!
- Crystal!

# Speed of connectivity {.semi-filtered data-background-image="images/connectivity.jpg"}

::: notes
- Mobile phone user penetration worldwide is expected to reach 63,4% in 2019
- Almost half the population of the planet has a Smart Phone
- Desktop internet usage is falling & mobile internet usage is rising
- Consumers downloaded 218 billion apps in 2020—and that number is climbing

# Speed of data transfer {.semi-filtered data-background-image="images/data_transfer.jpg"}

::: notes
re:Invent announcement in 2018 of new C5n instance instance type that will transfer 100 gigabits/sec

This new C6gn now supports double the EBS bandwidth of those C5n instances

Multi gigabit LTE speeds and now 5G

# Speed of adoption {.semi-filtered data-background-image="images/iot_adoption.png"}

::: notes
- Serverless and containers
  - How many are leveraging Serverless today?
    - Very specialized services rather than basic building blocks
        - Developers don’t have to be a sysadmin
    - AWS works with open source tools and has multiple internal and extenral OS teams
        - AWS offers managed versions of open source tools in the cloud

::: notes
- Change and the need to adapt
- Finding the time to learn
- Have been burnt by things that were supposed to work but didn’t
  - Bugs in products
  - Docs lagging behind or incorrect

Driven by the need to deliver fast
Amazon is really part of the problem here, how many of us expect to order something and have it in our hands in a day or even hours

# Ceiling of Complexity {data-background-image="images/dan_sullivan.jpg"}

> When you choose your future over your past, you enter a new stage of growth
-- Dan Sullivan

::: notes
All growth happens in stages

experience comes with a price of complexity

You work hard and are not making progress

Work smarter and not harder

Plone Conf and PyCon Story

- My First Conference (Plone Conference 1, October 15-17, 2003, New Orleans)
  - Followed by my second conf (PyCon 2004, the Second PyCon ever with about 250 at GWU, March 24-26, 2004)
  - PyCon Doubled in 2005 and now is almost 4k people each year.

- Ending up in a Austrian Castle in 2005 sprinting with the creators of Zope and Plone
  - You never know where these things are going to take you, enjoy the ride
  - You never know who is around you, you may run into an Austrian Prince

- Hence the importance of being at meetups and this event
- Want to hear about real stories from real people

So many of his items are about getting someone to show him something. Innovation does not happen alone.

## Little know facts participation

- Margaret Valtie is a Tulane Alumna and that was where my first conference was!  (small world, but that is the thing as we will see)

# Together {.semi-filtered data-background-image="images/team.png"}

::: notes
Great community

  - Shout out to Dave, Ross, Randal
  - Shout out to regional organizing meetups
  - Thank volunteers for this event specifically

## Final thoughts
  - it’s a journey and we are all in it together
  - Leonardo didn't innovate on his own or in a vaccuum

# Dimmi Dimmi Dimmi {data-background-image="images/leo.jpg"}

> "Tell me...tell me whether...tell me how things are...tell me if there was ever." -- Da Vinci

::: notes
End with the Dimmi Dimmi Dimmi quote

On one page of his notebooks from the early 1480's, you can see he has gotten a new pen and he's just doodling, testing it out, and as his mind wanders free, what does he write?
:::

# {.semi-filtered data-background-image="images/head_in_clouds.png"}
